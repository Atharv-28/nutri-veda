# NutriVeda - Diet Plan Generation Documentation

## Current Implementation (Basic Version)

### What We're Currently Using for Diet Plans Based on Assessment Results:

#### 1. **Assessment System**
- **Simple Point-Based Scoring**: Each question gives 2 points to Vata, Pitta, or Kapha
- **12 Traditional Questions**: Covering physical constitution, digestion, mental traits, etc.
- **Winner-Takes-All Logic**: Highest scoring dosha becomes the dominant type

#### 2. **Diet Plan Generation**
- **Static Predefined Plans**: Hardcoded meal plans for each dosha type
- **Basic Categorization**: Plans organized by breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks
- **General Principles**: Each dosha has general dietary guidelines
- **No Personalization**: Same plan for all people of the same dosha type

#### 3. **Current Algorithm Flow**
```
User answers 12 questions 
‚Üí System calculates dosha scores (Vata: X, Pitta: Y, Kapha: Z)
‚Üí Highest score = Dominant dosha
‚Üí System selects corresponding static diet plan
‚Üí User receives predefined meal suggestions
```

### Limitations of Current Approach:
- ‚ùå No consideration of age, activity level, health conditions
- ‚ùå No seasonal adjustments
- ‚ùå No personalized portion sizes or meal timing
- ‚ùå No integration of multiple dosha influences
- ‚ùå No progress tracking or plan adjustments
