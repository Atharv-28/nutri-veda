# Firebase Authentication Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- **File**: `src/config/firebaseConfig.js`
- Initialized Firebase app with authentication and Firestore
- Ready to accept your Firebase project credentials

### 2. Authentication Service
- **File**: `src/services/authService.js`
- Implemented functions:
  - `createAccount()` - Register new users (doctors/patients)
  - `signIn()` - Login with email and password
  - `signOutUser()` - Logout functionality
  - `getCurrentUser()` - Get logged-in user from local storage
  - `updateUserProfile()` - Update user data in Firestore

### 3. Updated Screens

#### Create Account Screens
- **CreateAccountPatient.js**
  - Now uses Firebase Authentication for registration
  - Saves patient data to Firestore `patients` collection
  - Shows loading indicator during registration
  - Better error handling and validation

- **CreateAccountDoctor.js**
  - Now uses Firebase Authentication for registration
  - Saves doctor data to Firestore `doctors` collection
  - Shows loading indicator during registration
  - Better error handling and validation

#### Login Screens
- **PatientLoginScreen.js**
  - Changed from username to email-based login
  - Authenticates with Firebase
  - Fetches user data from Firestore
  - Verifies user role matches "patient"
  - Shows loading indicator during login

- **DoctorLoginScreen.js**
  - Changed from username to email-based login
  - Authenticates with Firebase
  - Fetches user data from Firestore
  - Verifies user role matches "doctor"
  - Shows loading indicator during login

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ Passwords are handled by Firebase (not stored in Firestore)
- ✅ Email addresses are normalized (lowercase, trimmed)
- ✅ Role-based access (doctor/patient verification)
- ✅ Data stored separately in doctors/patients collections
- ✅ User data persisted locally using AsyncStorage

### User Experience
- ✅ Loading indicators during async operations
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Password length validation (minimum 6 characters)
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Automatic navigation after successful login/registration

### Data Persistence
- ✅ User data saved to Firestore
- ✅ User data cached locally with AsyncStorage
- ✅ Unique user ID (uid) from Firebase Authentication
- ✅ Timestamp tracking (createdAt)

## Next Steps

### Required Before Using
1. **Create Firebase Project** (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
2. **Enable Email/Password Authentication**
3. **Create Firestore Database**
4. **Update firebaseConfig.js with your credentials**

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Email Verification**
   - Send verification email on signup
   - Require verification before full access

2. **Password Reset**
   - Implement forgot password flow
   - Use Firebase's sendPasswordResetEmail()

3. **Profile Management**
   - Allow users to update their profile
   - Add profile photo upload to Firebase Storage

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement proper Firestore security rules
   - Add rate limiting
   - Enable App Check

5. **Better Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages
   - Network error recovery
   - Retry logic for failed requests

6. **Additional Features**
   - Remember me functionality
   - Social login (Google, Facebook)
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management

## Testing Checklist

### Patient Flow
- [ ] Create patient account
- [ ] Verify patient appears in Firebase Console > Authentication
- [ ] Verify patient data saved in Firestore > patients collection
- [ ] Login with patient credentials
- [ ] Navigate to Patient Dashboard with correct data
- [ ] Logout and verify session cleared

### Doctor Flow
- [ ] Create doctor account
- [ ] Verify doctor appears in Firebase Console > Authentication
- [ ] Verify doctor data saved in Firestore > doctors collection
- [ ] Login with doctor credentials
- [ ] Navigate to Doctor Dashboard with correct data
- [ ] Logout and verify session cleared

### Error Cases
- [ ] Try to create account with existing email
- [ ] Try to login with wrong password
- [ ] Try to login as patient with doctor account (should fail)
- [ ] Try to login as doctor with patient account (should fail)
- [ ] Test without internet connection
